With IR Illuminator:
- Use Dot pattern of 50 power

depth image corresponds to left IR image (infrared stream #1)
- I want to convert the depth info to meters

Things to do:
- We should set a world frame and keep it still somehow?
	- Maybe place an AruCo marker on the patient's bed on a stationary part to reduce errors
	- We will also be getting surface mesh of the patient
