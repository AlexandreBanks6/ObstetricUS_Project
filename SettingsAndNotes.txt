With IR Illuminator:
- Use Dot pattern of 50 power

depth image corresponds to left IR image (infrared stream #1)
- I want to convert the depth info to meters



Things to record:
have a rigid transform from appendage frame to US tip frame in a .txt

in calibrating.csv:
- Pose of xiphoid process and points on mother's stomach => Goes to a separate csv which is updated by GUI when pressed

in scannnig.csv:
Initially:
- Force zeroing (amount to offset x,y,z, computed at start using GUI)
- Force Calibration Matrix => stored in separate .csv, but imported
- Force Correction Matrix => stored in separate .csv, but imported

On every iteration
- Depth Video (corresponding frame in .csv) => This is what we synchronize to 
- US Video (corresponding frame in .csv) 
- Pose 
- Force
- IMU

scanning.csv format (header):

system time, run time, depth frame #, us frame #, CAM_T_US,T00,T01,T02,R00,R01,R02,R10,R11,R12,R20,R21,R22,FORCE_RAW,fr0,fr1,fr2,fr3,fr4,fr5,fr6,fr7,fr8,fr9,fr10,fr11,FORCE_XYZ,fx,fy,fz,IMU,temp,g0,g1,g2,a0,a1,a2


data directory organization:

- data => root_path
  - P01 => participant_directory (increments and creates new if NaN's, 
    - calibrating_datetime.csv
    - scanning_datetime.csv 
    - ...
  - P02
    - ...
